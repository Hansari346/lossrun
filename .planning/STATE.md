# Project State

## Project Reference
See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-02-12)
**Core value:** Reliably ingest any carrier's loss run format and produce compelling analysis
**Current focus:** Not started

## Phase Status

| Phase | Status | Started | Completed |
|-------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 1 — Foundation & Build Infrastructure | Not Started | — | — |
| 2 — Data Ingestion Pipeline | Not Started | — | — |
| 3 — Calculation Engine & Dimension Detection | Not Started | — | — |
| 4 — Adaptive Visualization & Data Tables | Not Started | — | — |
| 5 — PowerPoint Export | Not Started | — | — |
| 6 — Excel Export | Not Started | — | — |

## Current Phase
None — project initialized, ready for Phase 1

## Accumulated Context

### Key Decisions
- 2026-02-12: 6-phase roadmap derived from 28 requirements following the dependency chain: Foundation → Data → Calculations → Visualization → Export
- 2026-02-12: INFRA-04/05 grouped with DIM-01/02/03 in Phase 3 (calculation engine produces the Results Object, dimension detection determines what's in it)
- 2026-02-12: Phase 5 (PPT) and Phase 6 (Excel) can run in parallel — both depend on Phase 4, not on each other

### Blockers
None

### TODOs
None

## Session Log
- 2026-02-12: Project initialized, requirements defined (28 v1), research completed, roadmap created (6 phases)
